# Welcome to My Portfolio!  
## Introduction 
Hi, my name is Janatul, I usually just go by Jana! This portfolio showcases my work in Python programming, data analysis, Excel (including VBA), SQL, ETL pipelines, and more. Below, youâ€™ll find an overview of projects and assignments where I leveraged tools and technologies like Python, Excel, and SQL to extract insights, clean data, and develop effective solutions.

## Projects & Assignments

### Project 1: The Effect of Music on Mental Health 
#### Overview:
This project involves analyzing the effects of music on mental health based on data from a survey of over 700 participants. The dataset contains information on various factors such as age, hours spent listening to music, and the mental health conditions of the participants (anxiety, depression, OCD, insomnia).
#### Key Questions Explored:
1. The relationship between age and reported improvements in mental health from listening to music.
2. The impact of favorite music genres on mental health.
3. Music genres correlated with improving specific mental health issues.
4. The average number of hours spent listening to music per day by participants who reported mental health improvement.
5. The influence of music genre and daily listening duration on mental health improvement.
#### Technologies Used:
1. Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
2. Data Analysis and Visualization
3. Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code
#### Key Visualizations:
1. Pie Charts
2. Linear Regression Plots
3. Bar Charts
4. Scatter Plots
#### Repository:

#### Summary:
In this project, we worked with a dataset of survey responses to answer several key questions about the relationship between music and mental health. We used Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, producing various charts to better understand how music influences mental health across different genres and demographics.

### Project 2: 
Overview
In this project, my team and I developed an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process and analyze crowdfunding data from multiple sources. Using Python, we extracted data from various files, including CSV and Excel files, containing information about crowdfunding campaigns, categories, subcategories, and contacts. We cleaned, standardized, and merged the data, addressing any missing values, which ensured consistency and improved data quality for analysis. Finally, we loaded the transformed data into a structured format, ready for further analysis and insights. This project showcases our ability to build an ETL pipeline and manage data from multiple sources.

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
ETL Pipeline Development
Data Cleaning and Transformation
QuickDB for relational database design
Jupyter Notebooks
Key Visualizations:
Bar Charts
Line Charts
Data Visualizations (for various insights)
Repository:
Crowdfunding_ETL

Summary:
This project involved building an ETL pipeline to handle and process crowdfunding data. My team and I extracted raw data from CSV and Excel files, then cleaned, transformed, and merged it into a structured format for analysis. The project highlights my team's ability to work with large datasets, clean and prepare them for analysis, and build a pipeline to automate these processes. The final product was a well-organized dataset ready for analysis and further insights.

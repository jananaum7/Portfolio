## Introduction 
# Welcome to My Portfolio!  
Hi, my name is Janatul, I usually just go by Jana! This portfolio showcases my work in Python programming, data analysis, Excel (including VBA), SQL, ETL pipelines, and more. Below, youâ€™ll find an overview of projects and assignments where I leveraged tools and technologies like Python, Excel, and SQL to extract insights, clean data, and develop effective solutions.

## Projects & Assignments
### Project 1: The Effect of Music on Mental Health 
#### Overview:
This project involves analyzing the effects of music on mental health based on data from a survey of over 700 participants.

2. The impact of favorite music genres on mental health.
3. Music genres correlated with improving specific mental health issues.
4. The average number of hours spent listening to music per day by participants who reported mental health improvement.
5. The influence of music genre and daily listening duration on mental health improvement.
#### Technologies Used:
1. Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
2. Data Analysis and Visualization
3. Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code
#### Key Visualizations:
1. Pie Charts
2. Linear Regression Plots
3. Bar Charts
4. Scatter Plots
